# [Project : Moby Dick Word Frequency Counter](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MMallah/Word-Frequency-Counter-for-Moby-Dick-Novel/blob/main/Moby%20Dick%20Word%20Frequency%20counter.ipynb)

<p>What are the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick, and how often do they occur?</p>
<p>In this notebook, we'll scrape the novel <em>Moby Dick</em> from the website <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> (which contains a large corpus of books)
 
*  Using the Python package <code>requests</code>.
*  Then we'll extract words from this web data using <code>BeautifulSoup</code>. 
*  Finally, we'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (<code>nltk</code>) and <code>Counter</code>.</p>
